This is a pomodoro clock. In case you need guidelines how to use it, here you go:
Green circle is for setting the work time. Drag it to set your desirable work session time.
Red circle is for break time. Works exactly like the green one. Have fun with it.
Clicking or touching the main clock will start and stop the countdown.
You can change work and break time anytime you want but it will reset the current session.
And you can also use the reset button, which will stop the timers, and go back to work session.
